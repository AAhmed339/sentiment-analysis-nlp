# Sentiment Analysis using NLP (LSTM) with PyTorch

This project demonstrates a complete Natural Language Processing (NLP)
pipeline for sentiment analysis using PyTorch.

## Project Description
The model takes a sentence as input and predicts whether the sentiment is:
- Positive
- Negative

## NLP Pipeline
- Text preprocessing
- Tokenization
- Vocabulary building
- Encoding
- Padding
- Word Embeddings
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- Classification

## Model Architecture
Embedding → LSTM → Fully Connected → Softmax

## Files
- Ahmed_6.ipynb: Full implementation including training and inference

## Skills Covered
NLP • Tokenization • Embedding • LSTM • PyTorch • Deep Learning
